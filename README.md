## Text Mining
This folder contain all algortihm notebook to create required model. There are also tensorflow model. To load this model, you must use tensorflow nightly due to some features that still in beta.

update : we plan to change some algorithm to make it more confenient and accurate.

#### Instruction
1. Download or open at google colab
2. Run on jupyter notebook


## Web 

This folder contain user interface including web ui and REST APIs. Web and APIs build on top of flask with multiple library that can be found inside requirments.txt. 


## How This Work
We will release a journal detailing how this thing work. Please wait till it release or contact me directly via github or email.
